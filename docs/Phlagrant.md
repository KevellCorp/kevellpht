Phlagrant is the Virtual Machine management tool written as part of Pharoah tools.When we're working in a distributed environment or on large or complex applications, it's probably not the best solution for everyone to be developing on their host machine, as they'll all be configured differently. Using a Virtual Machine configured by the Devops or Admins that can be shared amongst all contributors, we can give contributors much more highly standardised or complex development environments.

 

If you have 10 in your team, using Windows, Mac, and different *nix flavours with a complex distributed or service/process consuming application - it becomes a nightmare quickly to have them all contributing reliable changes when their local development or test systems are technically different. Using Virtual Machines means everyone can contribute on their own platforms and tools, while ensuring that they are all contributing on an identical, solid, configurable, easily updatable development environment. This is an idea highly practised in Vagrant friendly development teams.

Phlagrant is at the core of our ideas on how to do devops, so take a look.
