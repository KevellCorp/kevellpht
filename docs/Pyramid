The bootstrap file in the Pyramid core is the front controller of your Pyramid application, and does a few bits. Here's an overview.

Sets exit codes. From anywhere in your application, you can set the exit code that the Pyramid application will exit with without immediately ending the application

Supplies parameters to the application. Defaults to using CLI parameters, but you can inject a PHP array, or environments variables containing JSON. This can be extended to use parameters from anywhere.

Chains the execution of controllers until one results in a view output, then processes the view and ends application exeution.
